- **Title:** JavaScript Prototypes Behind the Scenes
- **Date:** 2020-11-03
- **Location:** Virtual

## Abstract

JavaScript is a prototype-oriented language. But for many, what this
really means or how it actually works is a little fuzzy. It seems, that
as quickly as you learn how prototypes work behind the scenes, as
quickly do you forget it again. If you can relate to this feeling, this
talk is for you.

We’ll dive into why JavaScript is a prototype-oriented language instead
of class-based and what that means for you as a developer. You’ll learn
exactly how prototypal inheritance works in JavaScript - in a way that’s
easy to remember - so that you can become a better programmer.

Finally, you’ll learn about the security pitfalls that exist in the way
prototypal inheritance is implemented in JavaScript and how to write
more secure code to avoid those pitfalls.
