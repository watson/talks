- **Date:** 2019-06-07
- **Location:** Amsterdam, Netherlands

## Abstract

Post-Mortem debugging is a really powerful technique that allows you,
through the use of several tools, to take a memory dump when an issue
occurs in your application and later analyze it offline.

The talk will primarily focus on llnode and how you can use this tool to
better understand why a Node.js process is behaving odd or is crashing.
