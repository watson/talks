# DevOps Malmö Meetup

- **Title:** Logging, Metrics, and APM: The Holy Trinity of Operations
- **Date:** 2019-03-18
- **Location:** Malmö, Sweden

## Abstract

The Elastic Stack is used for operational analytics in many environments
today. However, we see many users taking advantage of only a limited set
of data sources in their Elastic deployments.

We’ll explore how the Elastic Stack can be used for a comprehensive
operational analytics deployment, including infrastructure and
application logging and metrics, as well as deep APM transaction
analysis.
