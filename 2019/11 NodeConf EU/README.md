# NodeConf EU 2019

- **Title:** The Trouble with Tracers
- **Date:** 2019-11-12
- **Location:** Kilkenny, Ireland

## Abstract

To get insights into the performance of your application and what
specifically it’s spending time on, you need good tracing tools.

Historically however, it’s been very difficult to implement tracers in
Node.js due to its async nature and the lack of an official context
propagation API in core.

Throw modern deployment architectures into the mix, and you also need to
deal with distributed tracing across multiple microservices.

This talk is about how tracers work behind the scenes, which pitfalls
exist and the work going on in the Node.js Diagnostics Working Group, in
W3C, and within other standard-organizations to improve the situation.
