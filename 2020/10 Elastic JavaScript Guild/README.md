## Abstract

Writing code that generates code is hard. But by leveraging knowlege of
how the V8 JavaScript engine optimizes code, we can use this technique
to write extremely fast data parsers, schema validators etc. In this
talk weâ€™ll learn how to write code that would make a mad scientist
jealous, pushes V8 to eleven and make Christopher Nolan consider a
sequel to Inception.
